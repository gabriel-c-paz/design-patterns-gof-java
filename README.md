# Implementation of design patterns in Java with real-world examples.

## Introduction
This repository contains the 24 design patterns (from GoF) separated into a respective branch for each one.

In each branch, you will have: 
  * the code, 
  * the class diagram,
  * the explanation of the pattern.

## Sources
